## ðŸ“¦ Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up the Angular Starter Project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** version `20.11.1` or higher
- **Angular CLI** version `18.2.12`
- **Docker** (for containerization)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wahabakram/angular-starter-project.git
cd angular-starter-project
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install all the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the application locally

To start the application locally, run:

```bash
npm start
```

If you want to access the app on a different host or port, use:

```bash
npm run start:host
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:4200`.

### 4. Running Tests

#### Unit Tests (Jest)

```bash
npm run test
```

To watch the tests:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

For test coverage report:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

For CI testing (no caching):

```bash
npm run test:ci
```

#### E2E Tests (Playwright)

Run Playwright E2E tests:

```bash
npm run e2e
```

Run Playwright tests in debug mode:

```bash
npm run e2e:debug
```

To show the test report:

```bash
npm run e2e:show-report
```

### 5. Linting & Formatting

#### Code Linting (ESLint)

```bash
npm run lint
```

Fix linting issues automatically:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

#### Style Linting (Stylelint)

```bash
npm run stylelint
```

To fix style issues:

```bash
npm run stylelint:fix
```

#### Code Formatting (Prettier)

```bash
npm run format
```

### 6. Storybook

To start Storybook locally:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

To build the Storybook static files:

```bash
npm run build:storybook
```

### 7. Docker Setup

To build and run the application using Docker, follow these steps:

#### Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t angular-starter-project .
```

#### Run the Docker container

```bash
docker run -p 4200:4200 angular-starter-project
```

This will run the application inside a Docker container, and you can access it at `http://localhost:4200`.

#### Docker Compose (Optional)

If you have a `docker-compose.yml` file set up, you can use it to run multiple containers (e.g., with backend services, databases, etc.):

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### ðŸŒ± Development Setup

#### Folder Structure

The project follows a clean, scalable folder structure with the following key directories:

```bash
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ features/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ store/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles/
â”œâ”€â”€ environments/
â”œâ”€â”€ storybook/
â””â”€â”€ test/
```

#### NgRx Store

State management is handled via **NgRx**. The app uses actions, reducers, and selectors for managing the application's state. Refer to the `store/` directory for the state management files.

### ðŸ”§ CI/CD with GitHub Workflows

The project comes with GitHub Actions CI workflows set up for continuous integration. Every push to the repository triggers tests, linting, and deployment workflows.

#### Deployments

Deployments to Firebase are automatically triggered on each push to the `main` branch. You can monitor the deployment process through the Firebase Console.

### ðŸ”’ Authentication & Authorization

The app integrates authentication and authorization. You can sign in using popular OAuth providers or use Firebase Authentication for easy integration. User roles and access control are managed using **NgRx Store**.
